As of May 2017, UNHCR has biometrically registered over 50,000 refugees in Khost province and 36,000 refugees in Paktika province, where access remains a challenge. Over 16,000 of these refugees receive shelter and essential services in the Gulan camp in Khost province, while most of the others live among the host population in various urban and rural locations. \nTo better understand the needs of the refugees and the host communities, UNHCR and WFP agreed to conduct a joint assessment of Pakistani refugees in Khost and Paktika. The data collection commenced in May 2017 and covered 2,638 refugee households (2,198 in Khost and 440 in Paktika).","coll_dates":[{"start":"2017-05-11","end":"2017-05-29","cycle":""}],"nation":[{"name":"Afghanistan","abbreviation":"AFG"}],"geog_coverage":"Areas hosting Pakistani refugees in Afghanistan's Khost and Paktika provinces.

The total population of Pakistani refugees in these provinces at the time of the survey was estimated at around 18,000 households.  \n\nFor this survey a stratified, two-stage (i.e.  clustered) sample design was applied. The 10 refugee-hosting districts of Khost and Paktika were considered sampling strata, but within these the refugee-dense locations of Gulan camp and Lakan (in Maton district) were considered separate strata, resulting in 12 sampling strata overall. Within each of these strata, first a selection of villages was drawn with probability-proportional-to-size, then second a selection of households was drawn from UNHCR's registration database. \n\nThe total sample size was 2,638 refugee households. \n\nNB: The original data collection also included a small number of households from the neighbouring host communities; however, these observations were dropped from the public-release version of the dataset.","sampling_deviation":"None.","coll_mode":"Face-to-face [f2f]","research_instrument":"All questionaires are provided in section \"external ressources\".","coll_situation":"Data was collected on paper through face-to-face interviews by 43 enumerators and 2 supervisors.
