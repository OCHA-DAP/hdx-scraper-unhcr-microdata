The main purpose was to validate the relevance of existing lists and obtain up-to-date information from home-based IDPs who decided to take part in the exercise so that the government, as well as other humanitarian and development actors, can make informed and consultative decisions while designing and targeting their assistance programs, including protection interventions. \nFollowing a piloting phase in June 2016, the full-blown profiling was conducted in July-August 2016 and reached 6,474 families from 66 barangays in Zamboanga. Of these, 1,135 families were assessed to be potential home-based IDPs based on the documents they presented. The profiling revealed that most home-based IDPs are living in barangays of Sta. Catalina, Sta. Barbara, Talon-Talon and Rio Hondo.","coll_dates":[{"start":"2016-07-01","end":"2016-08-31","cycle":""}],"nation":[{"name":"Philippines","abbreviation":"PHL"}],"geog_coverage":"The profiling exercise was conducted in 66 barangays under the Seven (7) District Offices in Zamboanga City known to be hosting home-based IDPs.

The main purpose is to validate relevance of existing lists and obtain up-to-date information, including contact details, from home-based IDPs who decided to take part in the exercise, which would help inform the government and other humanitarian actors in designing and targeting their assistance programs, including protection interventions, and pave ways to establish channels for regular dialogue with home-based IDPs for more inclusive and consultative programming."},"method":{"data_collection":{"data_collectors":[{"name":"UN High Commissioner for Refugees","abbreviation":"UNHCR","affiliation":""},{"name":"City Social Welfare and Development Office","abbreviation":"CSWDO","affiliation":""}],"sampling_procedure":"The current CSWDO master list and the results of profiling in December 2014, which made up the \"consolidated master list\", were used to help identify location of the IDPs.

Form B was intended for respondents who were not in the consolidated master list but were able to provide the documentation outlined above, confirming them to be home-based IDP. Form C, on the other hand, was intended for respondents whose names were not found in the master list, as well as those home-based IDPs who were assessed to have returned, awardees of permanent housing projects, and those who otherwise did not qualify under Forms A or B as they were not able to present the required documentation. \nForms A & B","coll_situation":"The data collection was made through a one-on-one interview with the head of the family, and if head of family was not available, with the spouse and\/or oldest dependent.

Each form was processed separately before processing the combined results of all forms. \nThere were two types of analysis for this re-profiling activity in relation to the stated objectives. Firstly, the analysis focuses on assessing the validity of the current government master list of home-based IDPs. The second type of analysis is the comparative analysis of the current and previous profiling to evaluate the trend and patterns of movement, and assess the protection condition of home-based IDPs."}},"data_access":{"dataset_use":{"contact":[{"name":"The Curation Team","affiliation":"UNHCR","email":"microdata@unhcr.org","uri":""},{"name":"Bienvinido Dagpin","affiliation":"UNHCR","email":"dagpin@unhcr.org","uri":""}],"cit_req":"UNHCR (2020).
